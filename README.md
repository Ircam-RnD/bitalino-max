## notes

OSX :   
all features are now covered, all versions of the board are supported,
and any number of them can be used simultaneously.

Windows :   
still work in progress, not yet compiling with VS2015. available binaries have
an old interface and might not work with the latest versions of the board.
pull requests are welcome.
